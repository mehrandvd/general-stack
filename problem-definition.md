# Problem Definition

Selecting a general stack to rely on for the next 3 years.
By stack, we mean:
 - Architecture
 - Platforms
 - Languages
 - Frameworks
 - Technologies

 This general stack is going to be used to develop all typical and general applications.
 It is obvious that in some situations, for some applications with very specific requirements it is possible to customize the stack.
 But to stay focused on business, we try to keep the guidelines of general stack, unless it is revealed that the stack is not good for the situation, then will take the cost and will customize the stack.

 ## Situation
 As the organization specification affects the solution, this is the current situation of the organization:

 - Software team size: 10-50
 - Organization size: 5000-10000
 - Customers: 1,000,000-10,000,000
 - Current experience: Developers have a basic to medium experience in C# and JavaScript (AngularJS 1.2). Also we have a few professionals in C#, a few in JavaScript and a few in Java.
 - Current applications: we have apps in:
   - Stack 1: C#, JavaScript, AngularJS 1.2, SQL Server
   - Stack 2: Java, Raw (No spring or ...), Prime Faces, SQL Server

 - We will have about 50 projects which will be developed with this general stack.
 - Some of these applications will target organization staff (5000-10000) and some of them will target customers (1,000,000-10,000,000)
