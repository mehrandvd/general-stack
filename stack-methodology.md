# Methodology

In this document we describe how do we pick and present our stack.

We breakdown the problem into these areas:
- Architecture
- Backend technology
- Web Frontend technology
- Mobile Frontend technology
- Database technology

For each area we will have the following sections.

## Why this?
In this section we propose our suggested _platforms_, _languages_, _frameworks_ and _technologies_. Also we describe the stack with enough details.

## Risks
We address the risks picking this stack. Then we describe how we are managing these risks.
